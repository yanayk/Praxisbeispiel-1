             <p class="licenseText">
                <i><b>In Short:</b> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason 
                (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into 
                or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</i>
<br><br>
<u><b>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you</b></u>
<br>
<br>
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:<br>

- <b>Consent</b>. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.
<br>- <b>Performance of a Contract</b>. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
<br>- <b>Legal Obligations</b>. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
<br>- <b>Vital Interests</b>. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.
<br><br>
<u><b>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</b></u>
<br><br>
We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred 
(i.e. implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.<br>
<br>
In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:<br>
- If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way
<br>
- For investigations and fraud detection and prevention<br>
- For business transactions provided certain conditions are met<br>
- If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim<br>
- For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin<br>
- If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse<br>
- If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province<br>
- If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records<br>
- If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced<br>
- If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes<br>
- If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations<br>
<br>
We may disclose de-identified information for approved research or statistics projects, subject to ethics oversight and confidentiality commitments

<p class = "Accessibility " id = "4" style="margin-top: 5%;">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>
             <p class="licenseText"><i><b>In Short:</b> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</i><br>
                <br>
                We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:<br>
- <b>Business Transfers</b>. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or 
acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
<br>
- <b>When we use Google Maps Platform APIs</b>. We may share your information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g. Google Maps API, Places API). Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to estimate your location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters, while Wi-Fi and cell towers help improve accuracy when GPS signals are weak, like indoors. This data helps Google Maps provide directions, but it is not always perfectly precise. We obtain and store on your device ('cache') your location for one (1) months. You may revoke 
your consent anytime by contacting us at the contact details provided at the end of this document.
             </p>
    <p class = "Accessibility " id = "5" style="margin-top: 5%;">5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>
             <p class="licenseText"><i><b>In Short:</b> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</i>
                <br><br> 
                We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent crashes, 
                fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.
                <br>
                We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and 
                services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.
                <br>
                To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a 'sale'/'sharing' (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below under section 
                <a href="#10">'DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?'</a>
                <br>
                Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.
             </p>
              <p class = "Accessibility " id = "6" style="margin-top: 5%;">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>
             <p class="licenseText"><i><b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</i>
                <br><br>
                We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will 
                require us keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year.
                <br>
                When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and 
                isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
             </p>

                We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

                In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us 
                by using the contact details provided in the section <a href ="#12">'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?'</a> below.

                <u><b>Withdrawing your consent</b></u>: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by

                 However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal

             <p class="licenseText">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications 
                include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy 
                preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology 
                standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
                 signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
                  online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
